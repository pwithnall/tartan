Tartan
======

Tartan is a set of tools and plugins for Clang which aim to improve its
usefulness for developing GLib and GNOME applications and libraries.

The first plugin in this set is a static analysis plugin to
utilise GObject introspection annotations to automatically add attributes to
functions and parameters in C code.

The second plugin utilises g_return_if_fail() preconditions to add attributes
to functions and parameters in C code.
